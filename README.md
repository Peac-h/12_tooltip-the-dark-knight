# Project 12 - CSS Tooltip & The Dark Knight

This is a css tooltip challenge by the [100dayscss](https://100dayscss.com/), except the design, which is coming from my comics love nature.

This is a small project with the purpose to level up my css skills.

Made fully responsive for all screen sizes, with some changes for non-hover devices.

**Let me know if you like it.**
